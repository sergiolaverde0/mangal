## 4.0.0

I've been actively working on this update lately, and I'm finally happy to share the 4th version of Mangal! üê≥

The most important feature this major version brings is significantly improved caching mechanism
which makes Mangal extremely fast and responsive.

Now, mangal makes almost no requests to the servers.
This includes Anilist, Scrapers, Update checker and so on!

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è  BREAKING!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è </strong> Please, read!</summary>

1. `mangal sources` will no longer list available sources, use `mangal sources list` instead.
2. `mangal gen` and `mangal install` were removed. Use `mangal sources gen` and `mangal sources install` instead.
3. `mangal sources remove` command improved and accepts flags instead of args.

Inline JSON output is different now.

- JSON fields now follow the [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) style instead of `PascalCase`
  (actually, using PascalCase was never a goal, I just forgot to properly configure it).
  But since it's a major release I can finally fix this.
- Structure was changed
- Additional fields were added

See [Inline mode wiki](https://github.com/metafates/mangal/wiki/Inline-mode) for new output schemas.

Please, consider these changes when migrating your applications that use mangal from 3rd version to 4th.

## 3.13.0

- Replace Mangakakalot with Manganato #102
- Move `install` & `gen` commands to `sources` subcommands. E.g. if you used `mangal install` before use `mangal sources install`. Old commands are still present, but marked as deprecated.

- New flag `--json` added for `config info` command to show fields in json format.

## 3.12.0

- Show current config field value in `config info` cmd

## 3.11.1

## 3.11.0

- Internal improvements.


## 3.10.0

- New feature: you can choose what anilist manga to link by pressing <kbd>a</kbd> in the manga chapters list.
  TUI mode only. This will affect what metadata is downloaded for the manga and what manga would be marked as read on your anilist profile.
- Pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> on the chapter will now open it for reading if other chapters aren't selected.
  Can be disabled with `mangal config set -k tui.read_on_enter -bv false`

  Can be disabled with `mangal config set -k anilist.link_on_manga_select -bv false`

- Option to reverse order of the chapters in the TUI. `mangal config set -k tui.reverse_chapters -bv true` to enable
- Reduce the size of the compiled binary by removing unused lua libraries. May break some lua scripts, but I don't think you were using AWS to scrape manga :)

## 3.9.1

- Fix version comparison mechanism for `update` command.
  Now it compares each fragment separately (major, minor, patch) instead of comparing two versions as strings lexicographically.

## 3.9.0

- New sources: [Mangakakalot](https://mangakakalot.com) & [Mangapill](https://mangapill.com)
- Fix termux installation detection by [@2096779623](https://github.com/2096779623) #94
- Change the way `mangal update` works.
  If mangal wasn't installed via package manager it will get the current location of running binary and replace it with the new one.
  Previously it was assumed that mangal was installed in `/usr/local/bin` which is not always the case.
  Doesn't work on Termux yet because it requires specific variation of Go compiler which is troublesome to configure with automatic release system that mangal uses.
  Will be fixed in the future.
